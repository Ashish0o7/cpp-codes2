Function Overloading :- (Compile Time Polymorphism)

In C++ , in a class we can write multiple functions with the same name provided
any 1 of the following 3 rules is followed :-

1) functions should differ in number of arguments

2) functions should differ in type of arguments

3) functions should differ in sequence of arguments

1) function instructions are copied onto main memory
2) all the parameters of function are loaded into stack
3) point of execution is transferred from calling function to the called function
4) code of function will be executed
5) point of execution will return to the calling function
*/


limitation of inline functions :

1) if function contains lots of code , compiler will ignore the keyword inline
2) function should not contain any loop
3) function should not contain static variable
4) function should not be recursive
